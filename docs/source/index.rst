Documentation for CultureMesh Android
=====================================

------------
Introduction
------------

This is the developer documentation for the Android app for CultureMesh. This
app remains in development, so this documentation is geared toward developers,
not end users.

This documentation and the source code for the app were created by Stanford
University's Code the Change for CultureMesh.

Missing Information
===================
For security reasons, some information is missing from the code repository:

* CultureMesh API Key: Stored in :java:ref:`Credentials`. The
  ``Credentials.java`` file must be created with the key in a public field
  ``APIKey``.
* Fabric API Key and Secret: Stored in ``app/fabric.properties``. See template
  below for the structure:

  .. code-block:: properties

    apiSecret=<API Secret>
    apiKey=<API Key>

  Fill in ``<API Secret>`` and ``<API Key>`` with the appropriate values.

Running the App
===============
Open the root of the repository in
`Android Studio <https://developer.android.com/studio/install>`_. Let
Android Studio index the repository. Then run the app by clicking the play
button in the upper right.
