==============
Code Reference
==============

The Android code is documented using Javadoc, which can be viewed in three
forms:

* Traditional `Javadoc <_static/API-JavaDoc/index.html>`_
  (includes ``Private`` methods)
* javasphinx :doc:`android/javadoc/packages` (excludes ``Private`` methods)
* The comments in the code itself

Specific sections of the javasphinx Javadoc are referenced throughout the
documentation like so: :java:ref:`API.Get`.
